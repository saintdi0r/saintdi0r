## <i> Hello there, the angel from my nightmare. </i> ðŸŽ€

Hey! I'm Ahri, I'm still studying programming, I'm more focused on learning about Python, PHP, I don't have a defined route, after all, what do I know, right? I know HTML and CSS, all thanks to my years on blogspot and tumblr, yes I revealed my age (I think this readme is a big revelation). Anyway, I'm Brazilian but I live in Yerevan, Armenia. "Ah Ahri, what did you go to Armenia for?" Wow, how unusual!" Guys, even I don't know. But, I'm here. And I'm here on Github to make study notes and network, so say hi whenever possible :D

Curiosities about me

* I'm addicted to Disney, not the parks (because I've never been), but Hannah Montana, That's so Raven, Wizards of Waverly Places, Zombies, High School Musical, I know everything and I'm always ready to debate them. I also love Formula 1 (du du du du, Max Verstappen), Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande;
* I like to create templates in Notion, most of these templates are for my reviews of music, books and films that I consume. Yes, I love writing (fanfics...);
* I used to be a mortician and cheerleader;
* I am a bigger advocate for Eating Disorder and Mental Health;
* I am a editor at Wikipedia.
